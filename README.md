An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. Comprising interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, ANNs can learn complex patterns and relationships from data. Neural networks use weights to adjust the strength of connections between neurons, and training involves optimizing these weights through iterative processes like backpropagation. Widely applied in machine learning, ANNs excel in tasks such as pattern recognition, image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and various regression and classification problems.
